##Algorithm implementation
We have fulfilled our assignment by implementing modified Differential Evolution algorithm. One of our tasks was to prepare code in the form of library so we have prepared R package containing our implementation. As described in preliminary documentation we have used COCO BBOB 2015 benchmarking framework to test implemented algorithm.

##Experiments
In order to test our algorithm we have planned to run BBOB multiple times for different parameters configuration. We have tested most notable parameters which we decided are:

* $\lambda$ - population size
* $\mu$ - offspring number
* $H$ - time horizon of archive

Rest of the parameters where set to defult values taken from the original paper.

We decided to test each value of $\mu$ and $H$ with each value of $\lambda$.

Additionally we have performed benchmarking of Differential Evolution algorithm from __DEoptim__ R package to compare our implementation of DES modification with standard form of DE.

### Parameters and labeling
We have tested 16 different configurations of tunable parameters. To keep track of them we hav labeled each $\lambda$ value with one of the letters $a,b,c$ and each $\mu$ or $H$ modification with digit from $1$ to $6$. Legend of the parameters and values we used is shown below:


### BBOB 2015 benchmark setup
 We used standard benchmark functions set consisting of 24 noise-less functions $f_i: R^n \rightarrow R, i=1,2,...,24$ with 15 instances each. Those function instances were optimized for dimensions $n=2,3,5,10,20,40$. We set budget for experiments to $10000$, maximum function evaluations per problem was equal to $MaxFEvals=BUDGET*n$ which may be not identical to evaluations per algorithm run because R language interface for BBOB implemented mechanism of independent restarts.
